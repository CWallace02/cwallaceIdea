        <h2>Information</h2>
       <p>
        A Secretary of State senior citizen accessibility transport. 
        Accessible for senior citizens who are homebound (due to illness or old age) SOS would transport their services to them, plus their assistance.
        This program is eligibile for adults 60 and over. Arrangements can be made for homebound individuals under the age of 60 years old. 
        There is an application process and assessment of the need for this supportive service. Requires a referral letter from a doctor or social worker.
        </p>
        <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2016/caring-invisible-homebound-importance-quality-measures">Common Wealth Fund</a>, an estimated 1.9 million U.S. adults age 65 or older are completely or mostly homebound, while another 5.3 million have functional limitations that make it hard for them to leave their homes. 
        Often these senior citizens lack access to many things such as ambulatory care, other needs, and activities of daily living. 
         </p>
      <p>
        Given this information I introduce the SOS Mobile, inspired by Meals on Wheels and home health care providers. Home health services provide assistance for the elderly in their daily lives. 
        Provided by home health aides skilled in providing treatment for illnesses and injuries to help people better their well-being.
        Meals on Wheels focus is to care for individuals whose diminished mobility makes it hard to shop for food, prepare meals, or socialize with others. 
        Their focus is a lot like our own; we are accessible for the same group of individuals making things easier and attainable in their everyday lives while homebound.
